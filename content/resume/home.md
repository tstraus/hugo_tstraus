### Experience
#### RG Group: Electrical Engineering Intern and Electronics Technician - Summer 2014
* Assisted with design, calibration, production methods, and manufacturing of the TOMI SteraMist decontamination system.
* Troubleshooting legacy control systems and circuit boards in order to upgrade.
* Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide and then applied a high voltage to the spray to transform it into a Reactive Oxygen Species. This causes cellular disruption of harmful organisms.
* Designed for sterilization use in the medical industry.

### Engineering Projects
#### 16-Bit Computer Architecture
* Designed a simple programmable 16-bit architecture and memory system.
* Fully documented in report and presented to ABET during reaccreditation.
* Later wrote an assembler to make programing much faster and simpler.

#### Wireless Water Quality Probe
* Uses dissolved oxygen, Ph level, and temperature sensors to gather long-term data on a body of water, casing designed in SolidWorks then 3D printed.
* Uses Wi-Fi to upload data to webserver for easy data retrieval.
* Weatherproof to withstand long term environmental data.

### Skills
* Experience programming in C, C++, Java, x86 and 8051 Assembly, Mathematica, and MATLAB
* In depth knowledge of SolidWorks, Eclipse, C, Logisim, Python, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Phoenix Contact and Siemens PLC's
* Experience with Inventor, Spice, Ladder Logic, FPGA's, circuit prototyping, Solid Edge
* Great time management, teamwork, leadership skills, and a hunger to learn

### Personal Activities
#### College
* Vice President of Elizabethtown College's Robotics and Machine Intelligence Club. Constructing a competitive land robot with full image processing.
* Mentor in the Elizabethtown Public Library S.T.E.M. Xplorer's Club, an after school youth science education club. Competes in the annual SeaPerch robot competition.
* Personal projects with Arduino and Atmel microcontrollers. Many of these led into the design of the Water Quality Probe.

#### High School
* Section and Student Leader in Spring Grove's Marching Band and Drumline.
* Member of Students Against Destructive Decisions (S.A.D.D.) for all four years.
